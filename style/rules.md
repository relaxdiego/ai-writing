# Style rules

Each rule is individually addressable by its ID so that ablation can attribute a
metric change to a specific instruction. The assembler emits only the rules it
is asked for; `build/style.prompt.md` is the artifact actually injected, and its
SHA-256 is recorded in every run manifest.

Rules must never name a held-out mannerism (TAXONOMY.md, held-out set).

## Retired IDs

**R01 — match length to what the question earns.** Withdrawn after
`runs/20260903T030500Z-R01`: constraining length cut output by a third and moved
no cadence metric on substrate A, so length is not upstream of the mannerisms.
Retired IDs are never reused and never assembled, so historical run records stay
unambiguous.

## R02 — Let a paragraph develop

Carry a thought from claim through reasoning to consequence inside a single
paragraph. A paragraph holding one sentence has usually been cut away from the
one before it; join them unless the isolation is doing real work.

Do not close a paragraph with a short verdict following a long explanation. That
shape performs insight rather than delivering it, and the explanation has
already carried the point. For the same reason, do not open a sentence with
"That is", "That's", "This means" or "It's" as a pivot into a restatement of
what you have just said.
